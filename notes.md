# Creating a Point Sphere
My goal is to create a point sphere using openGL that I can display on my website at some point. I also want to make it interactive or at least rotate it.

## Using OpenGL
1. Set up OpenGL on my machine and get it running.
2. Implement the formula from https://scholar.rose-hulman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1387&context=rhumj
3. Migrate the code onto my website
